/**
 * This interface defines a class in an EMF model for an SEIR disease model
 * label value. The values of this label record the number of population members
 * who are in one of four states with repsect to a particular disease.
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Susceptible</em> which means that they are not infected by the
 * disease, but they can become exposed (and later infected) to the disease.</li>
 * <li><em>Exposed</em> which means that they are infected with the disease,
 * but are not yet infectious to others. </li>
 * <li><em>Infectious</em> which means that population members are infected
 * with the disease and they can infect others. </li>
 * <li><em>Recovered</em> which means that population members are not
 * infected with the disease and <em>cannot</em> become infected by the
 * disease. Note that in some disease models a population member in the
 * <em>Recovered</em> state could transition to the <em>Susceptible</em>
 * state and then become a candidate for re-infection.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Sub-classes could introduce additional states in which population members
 * could exist.
