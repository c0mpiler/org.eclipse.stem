/**
 * This interface defines a class in an EMF model for an SIR disease model label
 * value. The values of this label record the number of population members who
 * are in one of three states with respect to a particular disease.
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Susceptible</em> which means that they are not infected by the
 * disease, but they can become infected by the disease.</li>
 * <li><em>Infectious</em> which means that population members are infected
 * with the disease and they can infect others. </li>
 * <li><em>Recovered</em> which means that population members are not
 * infected with the disease and <em>cannot</em> become infected by the
 * disease. Note that in some disease models a population member in the
 * <em>Recovered</em> state could transition to the <em>Susceptible</em>
 * state and then become a candidate for re-infection.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Sub-classes could introduce additional states in which population members
 * could exist.
