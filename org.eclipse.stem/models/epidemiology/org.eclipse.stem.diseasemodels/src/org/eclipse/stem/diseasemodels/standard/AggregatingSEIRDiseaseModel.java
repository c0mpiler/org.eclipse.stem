/**
 * This interface defines a class in an EMF model for an aggregating SEIR
 * disease model. This disease model determines its disease state values by
 * summing (aggregating) the (next) values of the labels of other SEIR disease
 * models. Typically, it is placed in a model that contains the target SEIR
 * disease model so that its
 * {@link Decorator#updateLabels(org.eclipse.stem.core.model.STEMTime, long)}
 * method will be called after the contained disease model. This ensures that
 * the "next" values that this model collects will be valid by the time it runs.
