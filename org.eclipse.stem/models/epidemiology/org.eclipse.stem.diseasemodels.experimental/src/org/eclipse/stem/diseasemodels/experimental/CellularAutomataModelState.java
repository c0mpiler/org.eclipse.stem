/**
 * This interface defines a class in an EMF model that contains state
 * information for a STEM cellular automata model's computations from one simulation cycle
 * to another. The basic idea is that the cellular automata model can store state
 * information in an instance and attach it to a cellular automata model label such that
 * when it revisits the label to compute its value it can refer to the state
 * information to as part of its computation. For instance, if the value of
 * a label is dependent on the values of other labels, references to those
 * labels could be "cached" in the state instance and not recomputed for each
 * cycle.
